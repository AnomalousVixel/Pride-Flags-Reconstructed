# Pride-Flags-Reconstructed
A collection of pride flags reconstructed as 16:9 SVG.

Okay, so this blew up.
Step 1: Have niche identity.
Step 2: Notice pride flag for that label is low-res and pixelated to hell and back.
Step 4: Try to rebuild it as a vector and end up falling down the rabbit hole of learning Inkscape and going on a ten hour, hyperfocus-driven building spree on the first night. RIP sleep schedule.

So here we are now! Where's here? Reconstructing pride flags from the ground up, one after another.

Ground rules:
1.) MUST honor the original. This isn't a redesign, reimagining, or take-over. That's not what this is for. This is an update and quality control project intended to optimize pride flags for modern displays. After all, the Internet is our vector for freedom and fellowship in the grander scheme. (Pun shamelessly intended.)
2.) Aspect ratio must be 16:9
3.) width="3840"
    height="2160"
    viewBox="0 0 3840 2160"
Yes, that means px measurements. We're looking for display optimization here.
4.) ALWAYS overlap elements. Edge-to-edge elements like stripes won't render properly in all cases.
5.) All stripes should start at 0x0 where applicable. Flip-symmetrical flags (e.g.: the Trans flag) should use as few elements as possible: for them, build up toward the center like a pyramid.
6.) Be exact. This is quality control at its core. Messily-placed and messily-sized elements are unacceptable. Each stripe on a 5-stripe flag should be exactly 1/5th of the flag's size unless the design specifically calls for something different.

Each reconstructed flag is to be a love-letter to the groups and communities they represent and a thank-you to the creativity and labor that grants us these icons to show us that we aren't alone in the world - that someone out there loves and accepts who and what we are, and someone out there shares our experience and self-concept.
